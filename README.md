# RP2040 Microphone Demos

Demos for testing the integrated microphone of a [Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect].  
The RP2040 can be used as a USB microphone audio device or for rudimentary standalone hotword recognition.  
The use cases were implemented based on two different build environments:  

- [PlatformIO]  
- [Arduino Pico SDK]  

Details can be found in the readme files of the projects.
